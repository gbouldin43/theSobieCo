            We are glad to see you here on the official SOBIE website! SOBIE is an annual academic conference that is held at the Sandestin Golf & Resort in San Destin, Florida which is shown to the right. As you can see, it is a beautiful destination, and a wonderful place for you and your family to enjoy while the conference is not in session. This year, the conference was from April 9th to April 11th, but don't worry, there will be another one next year. We don't want to bombard you with information immediately, but we do want you to be able to find everything on our website that you need to know. The homepage, the page you are on, consists of when the conference is, the history of SOBIE, SOBIE's mission, and a way that you can contact the SOBIE team to get more information. Along the top right of the website, you should see places to click that will direct you to other areas of our site. The registration page should have everything you need to register for the conference, the destination page will give travel information, discounts on the resort, and ways to book your stay, and the call for papers page will have all the necessary information you will need if you plan to present at the conference. Feel free to browse through the website and make yourself at home, and don't be shy to contact us!

                The <b>SOBIE</b> mission is to encourage business faculty members to respond to current economic and market
                issues, and find practical solutions to the many problems business people and public policymakers confront.

              <li class="list-group-item">
                <b>SOBIE</b> invites business and economic research, as well as interdisciplinary research. Research is
                essential to the continuity and pursuit of knowledge. The seeds for economic growth, market innovation, more
                effective business practices, consumer trends, and greater profits often come from the ideas we germinate
                through our
                research.

              <li class="list-group-item">
                <b>SOBIE</b> was founded on the idea that peer-reviewed research at small colleges and regional universities was
                viable and needed to be recognized. Faculty, non-academic professionals, business people, doctoral candidates,
                graduate students, and undergraduate students are invited to participate.
